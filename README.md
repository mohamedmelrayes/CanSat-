# CanSat Project


## Overview

The CanSat Project is a miniature satellite project developed during university studies. It involves the integration of various hardware components such as a BMP sensor, GPS module, Arduino microcontroller, and NRF modules to create a functional satellite system capable of collecting environmental data.

## Hardware Components

- **BMP Sensor:** Measures temperature and pressure.
- **GPS Module:** Obtains location information.
- **Arduino Microcontroller:** Controls sensor data collection and communication.
- **NRF Modules:** Enable wireless communication between the CanSat and ground station.

## Software Components

- **Arduino Sketches:** Control the operation of the CanSat, including sensor data collection and communication protocols.

## System Architecture

The CanSat system architecture consists of interconnected hardware components controlled by Arduino microcontrollers. Sensor data is collected, processed, and transmitted wirelessly using NRF modules.

## Functionality

The CanSat project offers the following functionality:

- Collecting temperature and pressure data using the BMP sensor.
- Obtaining location information using the GPS module.
- Transmitting sensor data wirelessly to a ground station using NRF modules.

## How to Use

1. **Assemble the Hardware:** Connect the hardware components according to the provided schematic.
2. **Upload Arduino Sketches:** Upload the provided Arduino sketches to the Arduino microcontroller.
3. **Power On the CanSat:** Power on the CanSat and ground station.
4. **Monitor Sensor Data:** Monitor the sensor data and location information received on the ground station.

## Results and Observations

During testing, the CanSat successfully collected sensor data and transmitted it to the ground station. The collected data was analyzed to gain insights into environmental conditions at different altitudes.

## Future Work

Potential future improvements or extensions to the CanSat project include adding additional sensors for more comprehensive environmental data collection and enhancing communication protocols for increased data reliability.
