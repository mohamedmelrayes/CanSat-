# CanSat Project

**Overview**

The CanSat project is a miniature satellite designed to fit inside a soda can. It utilizes various hardware components such as a BMP sensor, GPS module, Arduino microcontroller, and NRF modules for communication. The project aims to collect environmental data and transmit it wirelessly to a ground station.

**Hardware Components**

BMP Sensor: Measures temperature and pressure.
GPS Module: Obtains location information.
Arduino Microcontroller: Controls sensor data collection and communication.
NRF Modules: Enable wireless communication between the CanSat and ground station.

**Software Components**

Arduino Sketches: Control the operation of the CanSat, including sensor data collection and communication protocols.

**System Architecture**

The CanSat system architecture consists of interconnected hardware components controlled by Arduino microcontrollers. Sensor data is collected, processed, and transmitted wirelessly using NRF modules.

**Functionality**

The CanSat project offers the following functionality:

Collecting temperature and pressure data using the BMP sensor.
Obtaining location information using the GPS module.
Transmitting sensor data wirelessly to a ground station using NRF modules.

**How to Use**

To use the CanSat:

Assemble the hardware components as per the provided schematic.

Upload the Arduino sketches to the Arduino microcontroller.

Power on the CanSat and ground station.

Monitor sensor data and location information received on the ground station.

Results and Observations

During testing, the CanSat successfully collected sensor data and transmitted it to the ground station. The collected data was analyzed to gain insights into environmental conditions at different altitudes.

**Future Work**

Future improvements and extensions to the CanSat project include:
Adding additional sensors for more comprehensive environmental data collection.
Implementing advanced communication protocols for increased data reliability.
Optimizing power consumption for extended mission durations.
